# 📱 Phone Status Monitor Simulator  
A simple **Python OOP Simulation** project that simulates the behaviour of a mobile phone.  
The simulator keeps track of your phone’s **battery, balance, and data**, and lets you perform everyday actions like charging, topping up,buying data bundles, making calls, sending messsages and browsing.    
The project provides a simple yet practical way to demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, methods, and state management in Python classes while reflecting real-world mobile phone usage.

## 🔑 Features  
- **Battery Monitoring** → charge the phone by time or by percent.  
- **Balance Tracking** → top up in dollars and use it for calls or data.  
- **Data Management** → buy data bundles with your balance.  
- **Call Simulation** → make calls that reduce balance and battery.  
- **Browsing Simulation** → browse the internet based on duration and usage profile:  
  - *Light* (chatting, light apps)  
  - *Normal* (social media)  
  - *Heavy* (video streaming)  
- **Sms Simulation** → Sends messages that reduce balance and battery.
- **Status Display** → check the phone’s current state with a simple battery bar.

## 🎯 Learning Goals  
This project is designed for **beginners learning OOP in Python**.  
It demonstrates how:  
- **Classes** act as blueprints.  
- **Objects** represent real things (your phone).  
- **Attributes** store state (battery, balance, data).  
- **Methods** define actions (charge, call, browse).
